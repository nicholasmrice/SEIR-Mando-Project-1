# SEIR-Mando-Project-1

Used the API footballdata.org to pull info regarding upcoming matches in the English Premier League, breaking down the information from the Object accessed via ajax to create match cards for all remaining games featuring what matchday it is, the home and away teams and the betting odds, from this information the user can make their choice and click the button of which team they think will win the match.

The technologies used was primarily Javascript, HTML and CSS while also using jquery and ajax to pull back jsom from the API.

The approach taken was to add and organize the data, adding as much functionality as possible along the way. Unfortunately i ran into some problems, whether it be from inexperience or the style of the API(i actually switched the one i was using on friday because i could not get it to pull back data effectively), but regardless this led to a reduced amount of functionality compared to what i had envisioned. Overall i hope going forward this can be used as a learning experience.

I attempted to add a modal and then a carousel but neither ultimately functioned properly, i left the code i had for the carousel commented out within the files.
